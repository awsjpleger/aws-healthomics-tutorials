# AWS HealthOmics Tutorials

Example code that demonstrates how to store, process, and query genomic and biological datasets using AWS HealthOmics

## Background

[AWS HealthOmics](https://aws.amazon.com/omics/) helps healthcare and life sciences customers store, query, analyze, and generate insights from genomic and other biological data to improve human health.

This repository contains resources (e.g. code scripts, example workflows, etc) that demonstrate the usage of AWS HealthOmics.

## Tutorials
### Generative AI
* [Rapidly generate and run and analyze](./generative-ai/README.md) workflows using natural langauge prompts and [Kiro CLI](https://kiro.dev/cli/).
* [Using Agentic AI and MCP](./generative-ai/README-MCP.md) for natural language interactions with AWS HealthOmics.
### Analytics
* [Create S3Table bucket tables and import VCF and GVCF files](./variant-database/): Setup S3Table bucket tables to hold variant data and import variant data into a iceberg data warehouse suitable for integration with AWS analytics tools such as Athena, Redshift, EMR and others.
